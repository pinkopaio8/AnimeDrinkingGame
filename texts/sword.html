    <p align="center"> I am the bone of my sword <br>
    Steel is my body and fire is my blood <br>
    I have created over a thousand blades <br>
    Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life <br>
    Have withstood pain to create many weapons <br>
    Yet, those hands will never hold anything <br>
    So as I pray, unlimited blade works.</p>
